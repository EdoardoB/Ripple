# Ripple ðŸŒŠ

Welcome to **Ripple** - a command line tool that reports unused localization strings in your Xcode project.

## Install

### Mint
[Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) is a package manager that installs and runs Swift command line tool packages. Make sure
you have Xcode installed, then:

### Clone from repo

```bash
> git clone 
> cd Ripple
> swift build -c release
> sudo cp .build/release/Ripple /usr/local/bin/ripple
```

## Usage

Navigate to your project folder, then:

```shell
> ripple
```

This command will scan current folder to find unused localized strings.

To get help you can use:

```shell
> ripple --help

    -p, --project: 
        Root path of your Xcode project. Default is current folder.
    -e, --exclude:
      Exclude paths from search.
    --version:
        Print tool version.
    -h, --help:
        HELP ME!
```

### Command line example

```shell
> ripple --exclude Pods
```

This command will search in current folder and skip `Pods` folder. It is recommended that you exclude third party folders.

### Use in Xcode build phase
You can integrate Ripple into your Xcode build process, so every time you build your project Ripple informs you about all unused localized strings.

Add a "Run Script" phase in the Build Phases tab:

```bash
Ripple -e Pods
```
